# File Transfer Program

This project allows users to start or connect to a file transfer server to send and recieve files from. 

This project helped me learn and understand sockets, sending data, and creating interfaces between clients and servers.

#### Unfinished

Still needs a shutdown listener for the FTserver.

Unfinished documentation.
