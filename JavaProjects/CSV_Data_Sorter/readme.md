This project is a simple application that can sort numerical or textual CSV data.

This project was started to help me understand reading from files, writing to files, and how CSV data is structured and manipulated.

Usage:

java CSV_Data_Sorter.Main [Path to File]

Example:

java CSV_Data_Sorter.Main test.csv
