This project was created to help me learn more about Java EE, Servlets, and JSON.

The UI is written in HTML/CSS/Javascript and utilizes AJAX requests to the server to send, recieve, and manipulate JSON data. This project uses the simple JSON library to help parse and manipulate JSON data.

The server runs the Servlet Container Apache Tomcat to implement the Servlets and Filters to control the responses to the HTTP requests.
