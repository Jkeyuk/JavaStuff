This project was created to help me understand the basics of Java EE and using Servlets. 
This Web App uses a RESTfull web service for a client to interact with a SQlite database to manage parcels in holding.

The UI is written in HTML/CSS/Javascript and utilize's AJAX requests to the server to update information on the webpage.

The server runs the Servlet Container Apache Tomcat to implement the Servlets and Filters to control the responses to the HTTP requests.
