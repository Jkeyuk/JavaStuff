This project was created to help me understand RSS feeds, XML, and how to parse XML using JAVAs DOM parsing technique.

This application asks the user for the address of their RSS feed. It then parses the feed using a DOM parser. Each item's title, 
description, and link are displayed to the user, and the application then asks which link from the feed the user would like to visit.
